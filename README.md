# Parking Lot Low Level Design

The parking lot should support parking of 3 types of car namely - SUV, SEDAN and EV.

A Valet assists in the car parking and makes sure parking tickets are assigned back to the right customers.

The following rules must be followed while parking the car.
1. EV parking spots can accommodate EV, SUV and sedan cars.
2. SUV cars should preferably be parked in SUV section but not in regular section.
3. Sedans can be parked anywhere. 
4. If parking is not possible in preferred ways, other ways must be explored to park the car if parking space is available and constraints are satisfied.

Adhere to the best practices and SOLID principles while coding the solution.
